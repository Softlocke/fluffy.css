# fluffy.css
Our CSS Flexbox-based framework, with graceful fallback to a % based grid. We use this framework on all our websites, and as such it does contain our base styling, however this is all located in variables.scss, so you can easily edit it for your own application if you wish to build from source. We use gulp, and a gulpfile is included with the project, but you may feel free to build it however you wish.

# Contributing
We would love for your help! Please submit all changes to the _develop_ branch.

# Building from Source
To build from source, simply install the required node modules and run gulp. You should then have an updated compiled.min.css, with full source maps.
